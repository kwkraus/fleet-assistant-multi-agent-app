# Fleet Multi-Agent Virtual Assistant â€” Step-by-Step Blueprint (Azure AI Foundry Edition)

This blueprint builds a multi-tenant fleet management AI assistant using **Azure AI Foundry** for LLM orchestration and **Semantic Kernel** for agent coordination. The system uses a single orchestrator that routes to specialized agents with tenant-specific integrations.

## Architecture Overview

- **Single Azure Function** with orchestrator + specialized agents
- **Planning Agent** coordinates all requests and calls sub-agents
- **Tenant-specific Integration Plugins** (GeoTab, Fleetio, Samsara, etc.)
- **Azure AI Foundry** for model routing and selection
- **OIDC/OAuth** authentication with role-based authorization
- **Graceful degradation** when integrations fail

## 0. Initialize Solution Structure

### 0.1. Create Projects & Shared Libraries
```text
- Create solution `FleetAssistant.sln` with projects:
    - `FleetAssistant.Api` (.NET Azure Functions v4 - Single Function)
    - `FleetAssistant.Agents` (class library for all agent implementations)
    - `FleetAssistant.Shared` (models, DTOs, utilities)
    - `FleetAssistant.Infrastructure` (plugins, credentials, config)
    - `Tests.FleetAssistant.Api` (XUnit test project)
    - `Tests.FleetAssistant.Agents` (XUnit test project)
```

---

## 1. Build Planning Agent & Core Infrastructure

### 1.1. Create Main HTTP Endpoint
```text
- In `FleetAssistant.Api`, add POST `/api/fleet/query`.
- Accepts: `{ message: string, conversationHistory?: object[], context?: object }`.
- JWT-based authentication with tenant validation.
- Returns: `{ response: string, agentData: object, warnings?: string[] }`.
```

### 1.2. Implement Authentication & Authorization
```text
- Add JWT middleware for OIDC/OAuth token validation.
- Extract user roles and authorized tenantIds from JWT claims.
- Create authorization service for tenant access validation.
- Test: Valid JWT allows access, invalid/expired JWT returns 401.
```

### 1.3. Implement Planning Agent with Azure AI Foundry
```text
- In `FleetAssistant.Agents`, create `PlanningAgent` class.
- Instantiate Semantic Kernel with Azure AI Foundry model router:
    - Use Azure AI Foundry SDK for model routing (no direct OpenAI calls).
    - Pass tenantId and user context to Foundry for model selection.
    - Create planning prompts to determine which sub-agents to call.
- Example flow:
    User: "What's the TCO for vehicle ABC123?"
    Planning Agent: Determines needs fuel + maintenance + insurance data
    Planning Agent: Calls FuelAgent, MaintenanceAgent, InsuranceAgent
    Planning Agent: Aggregates results with graceful degradation
- Test: Planning agent can parse user intent and route to appropriate sub-agents.
```

---

## 2. Build Integration Plugin System

### 2.1. Define Integration Plugin Interfaces
```text
- In `FleetAssistant.Infrastructure`:
    - `IIntegrationPluginBuilder` with:
        string Key { get; }
        Task<KernelPlugin?> BuildPluginAsync(string tenantId);
    - `IIntegrationConfigStore` for getting tenant-enabled integrations.
    - `ICredentialStore` for secure tenant credential retrieval.
    - `IntegrationPluginRegistry` that DI-injects all builders.
```

### 2.2. Implement Configuration & Credential Stores
```text
- `IntegrationConfigStore`:
    - `GetEnabledIntegrationsAsync(tenantId)` returns list of enabled integration keys.
    - Use `IDistributedCache` with 30min TTL for tenant configs.
    - Stub implementation returns hardcoded list for testing.
- `CredentialStore`:
    - `GetCredentialsAsync(tenantId, integrationKey)` returns auth details.
    - Stub implementation with fake credentials, later implement Key Vault.
- Test: Config store returns correct enabled integrations per tenant.
```

### 2.3. Create Stub Integration Plugin Builders
```text
- Add concrete plugin builders in `FleetAssistant.Infrastructure`:
    - `GeoTabPluginBuilder`, `FleetioPluginBuilder`, `SamsaraPluginBuilder`
    - Each implements `IIntegrationPluginBuilder` with unique Key.
    - BuildPluginAsync() creates Semantic Kernel plugin with dummy methods.
    - Example: GeoTabPlugin with `GetFuelDataAsync(vehicleId, startDate, endDate)`.
- Wire builders into `IntegrationPluginRegistry` via DI.
- Test: Registry returns correct builder by key; builder creates working plugin.
```

---

## 3. Build Specialized Agents

### 3.1. Create Base Agent Infrastructure
```text
- In `FleetAssistant.Agents`, create `BaseAgent` abstract class:
    - Protected method for creating Azure AI Foundry-enabled kernel per agent.
    - `RegisterIntegrationPluginsAsync(kernel, tenantId)` method.
    - Error handling for graceful degradation.
- Each agent gets its own kernel instance with relevant plugins only.
```

### 3.2. Implement Fuel Agent
```text
- Create `FuelAgent` inheriting from `BaseAgent`.
- `GetFuelAnalysisAsync(tenantId, vehicleId, timeframe, conversationContext)`.
- Agent creates its own kernel with Azure AI Foundry router.
- Dynamically loads fuel-related integration plugins based on tenant config.
- Returns structured fuel data or graceful error message.
- Test: Agent can process fuel queries with mock integrations.
```

### 3.3. Implement Additional Specialist Agents
```text
- Create `MaintenanceAgent`, `InsuranceAgent`, `TaxAgent` following same pattern.
- Each agent:
    - Has its own Azure AI Foundry-enabled kernel.
    - Loads only relevant integration plugins for its domain.
    - Handles errors gracefully (returns partial data + warnings).
    - Accepts conversation context from Planning Agent.
- Test: Each agent can process domain-specific queries independently.
```

### 3.4. Wire Agents into Planning Agent
```text
- Planning Agent orchestrates calls to specialist agents:
    - Analyzes user intent to determine which agents to call.
    - Passes relevant context (vehicleId, timeframe) to each agent.
    - Aggregates responses with graceful degradation.
    - Returns combined response with warnings for any failed agents.
- Integration test: End-to-end flow through planning agent to specialist agents.
```

---

## 4. Implement Real Integration Plugins

### 4.1. Build GeoTab Integration Plugin
```text
- Implement real GeoTab API client in `GeoTabPluginBuilder`.
- Methods: `GetFuelDataAsync`, `GetMaintenanceDataAsync`, `GetVehicleDataAsync`.
- Use tenant credentials from `ICredentialStore`.
- Implement session caching with `IDistributedCache`:
    - Cache GeoTab session tokens with TTL (6 hours).
    - Refresh sessions automatically on expiration.
- Handle API errors gracefully (return null, log warnings).
- Test: Plugin successfully authenticates and retrieves mock data from GeoTab.
```

### 4.2. Implement Additional Integration Plugins
```text
- Create `FleetioPluginBuilder`, `SamsaraPluginBuilder` following GeoTab pattern.
- Each plugin handles its own authentication, session management, and caching.
- Plugins pull their own detailed configuration on-demand (not from planning agent).
- Standardize error handling across all plugins.
- Test: Multiple plugins can operate simultaneously for multi-integration tenants.
```

---

## 5. Implement Advanced Features

### 5.1. Add Comprehensive Error Handling & Observability
```text
- Wrap all agent calls, plugin operations, and external API calls in try/catch.
- Use structured logging with tenantId, userId, agentType, integrationKey context.
- Add OpenTelemetry tracing for:
    - HTTP requests to the main endpoint
    - Planning agent orchestration
    - Individual agent execution
    - Integration plugin API calls
- Return HTTP 500 with traceId for unhandled exceptions.
- Test: Verify proper error boundaries and logging in failure scenarios.
```

### 5.2. Enhance Configuration Management
```text
- Implement production-ready `IntegrationConfigStore`:
    - Database-backed tenant configuration storage.
    - Admin API endpoints for managing tenant integrations.
    - Cache invalidation mechanisms for real-time updates.
- Implement production `CredentialStore` with Azure Key Vault.
